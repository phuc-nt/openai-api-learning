m/hole_in_my_heart,Frank Scheck,True,Hollywood Reporter,Rotten,,2005-04-11,"An experimental, transgressive work that pretty much fails on every level."
m/anchorman,Susan Granger,False,Modamag.com,Fresh,7/10,2004-07-09,"An enthusiastic, harmlessly silly celebration of the empancipation of the TV newsroom."
m/cheaper_by_the_dozen_2,Tony Wong,True,Toronto Star,Rotten,1.5/4,2005-12-21,"Sequels tend to be stupider by the dozen, and part two is perhaps overshadowed only by the banality and pointlessness of say, Leprechaun 6."
m/red_2,Jeff Meyers,False,"Metro Times (Detroit, MI)",Fresh,,2013-07-19,"Bruce Willis expends so little energy shaping his umpteenth action persona that he can't even be bothered to crack a smile. Luckily, Helen Mirren, Mary Louis Parker, Brian Cox and John Malkovich are all-too happy to step in and steal the limelight."
m/munich,Jack Mathews,True,New York Daily News,Rotten,2.5/4,2005-12-27,"The failure of a movie that is so good in so many ways leaves me to wonder if Spielberg is up to this kind of complex, multitasking story."
m/1135882-uncovered_the_war_on_iraq,Michael O'Sullivan,True,Washington Post,Rotten,,2004-08-20,"After listening to this steady anti-Bush drumbeat for the past several months, even the most devout progressives may start to feel as if they've heard much of this sermon a hundred times before."
m/after_the_ball_2014,Andrew Barker,True,Variety,Rotten,,2015-04-24,Portia Doubleday stars in a frothy teen comedy as unobjectionable as it is unmemorable.
m/the_dilemma,Wesley Morris,True,Boston Globe,Rotten,1/4,2011-01-13,"A comedy that seems terrified to acknowledge its darker, more sinister self, it's like an overmedicated patient or an addict in dread of relapse."
m/1204946-children,Lucius Gore,False,ESplatter,Fresh,3.5/4,2009-04-02,"As killer kid horror movies go, 'The Children' is easily one of the best."
m/marrowbone,Dan Jolin,False,Empire Magazine,Fresh,3/5,2018-07-11,A solid rather than spectacular creepshow thriller that would have benefited from SÃ¡nchez employing a few more original ideas.
m/its_a_disaster,Dan Jardine,False,Cinemania,Rotten,44/100,2014-01-12,As visually interesting as nuclear fallout.
m/the_iron_lady,Ken Hanke,False,"Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)",Fresh,4/5,2012-01-19,A two-and-a-half-star movie raised to four-star status solely on the performances of Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent.
m/star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens,Terri Schwartz,False,IGN Movies,Fresh,8.8/10,2015-12-16,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the movie it was promised to be, with great new characters, a respect for the original trilogy and a strong understanding of what makes this franchise click with fans."
m/amour_2013,Derek Smith,False,Tiny Mix Tapes,Fresh,,2017-10-04,"What the film lacks in Haneke's usually impressive formal rigor, it makes up for with truly earned emotional truths."

m/solo_a_star_wars_story,John Urbancich,False,Your Movies (cleveland.com),Fresh,3/5,2018-05-25,Han and Chewie heading into warp speed (then flashback) might have provided the early bolt the first act sorely needs. Still. it's an OK space vehicle for anyone but 'Star Wars' junkies likely expecting a better ride.
m/prairie_home_companion,Phoebe Flowers,False,South Florida Sun-Sentinel,Fresh,3/4,2006-06-08,"If one were to bring the sprawling program, which practically formulates nostalgia as a tangible commodity, to a movie screen, one couldn't hope for a better director than Robert Altman."
m/great_expectations_2012,Kyle Smith,True,New York Post,Fresh,2.5/4,2013-11-07,"An honorable, sober but completely unnecessary take on the Dickens novel, ""Great Expectations"" serves as a fine introduction to the story but won't excite those familiar with previous versions."
m/kinky_boots,Elizabeth Weitzman,True,New York Daily News,Rotten,2/4,2006-04-14,"Despite the subject matter, the script and direction are disappointingly conventional, though the performances are appealingly spirited."

m/1175178-jane_austen_book_club,Gina Carbone,False,Seacoast Newspapers (NH/Maine),Fresh,3/4,2007-10-08,I challenge any man and woman who enjoyed Transformers or Resident Evil to watch The Jane Austen Book Club and see if they can't get through the whole thing without even one eye roll. I bet they can do it.

m/norbit,Drew Turney,False,Dark Horizons,Rotten,,2008-01-15,"The laughs are broad (pardon the pun), obtuse, and unsubtle."
m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Michael Sauter,True,Entertainment Weekly,Fresh,B,2014-12-08,"Sure, some of the puns and in-jokes sound a little dated, but any movie that strings together lines from Shakespeare merely as a throwaway comic riff is, in my book, a film for the ages."
m/war_dogs_2016,Brian Gibson,False,"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)",Rotten,,2016-09-30,"More a bland weapons-biz infomercial (ending with the crime-doesn't-pay fine print blown up to fill your widescreen) than a hard, sharp look at gunrunning or war-profiteering."
m/1029314-dick_tracy,James Plath,False,Movie Metropolis,Fresh,7/10,2012-12-10,"""Dick Tracy"" isn't in the top tier of comic-book adaptations, but ingenuous art direction and set decoration and some crazy make-up jobs create a film that's still a delight to watch."
m/beautiful_girls,Janet Maslin,True,New York Times,Fresh,,2000-01-01,"Portman, a budding knockout, is scene-stealingly good even in an overly showy role."
m/1001193-around_the_world_in_80_days,MaryAnn Johanson,False,Flick Filosopher,Rotten,,2002-08-06,The novelty these far-flung places must have had for a 1956 audience is a bit lessened for the viewer today.
m/foxcatcher,Stuart Klawans,False,The Nation,Fresh,,2014-11-13,"A story filled with dread but no suspense: a fable of the misunderstanding, heartbreak, irony and absurdity that can abound in America when two social classes grapple in mutual desire and animosity."
m/carnage,J. R. Jones,True,Chicago Reader,Fresh,,2012-01-12,"Foster is particularly impressive in a stridently unattractive role, as the pinched, angry liberal who's orchestrated the meeting but doesn't get quite the apology she wants."
m/sling_blade,Brian D. Johnson,False,Maclean's Magazine,Fresh,,2019-10-30,"Stretched over 141 minutes, and threaded with humor, it is remarkably spare and simple, a slow movie about a slow man-Forrest Gump Unplugged."

m/requiem_for_the_american_dream,Martin Tsai,True,Los Angeles Times,Fresh,,2016-03-11,"The film isn't necessarily pegged to the upcoming election per se, but the logic presented within helps make sense of current affairs."
m/anna_and_the_apocalypse,James Clay,False,Fresh Fiction,Rotten,D,2018-12-13,"ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE is no doubt a crowd-pleaser that wears its heart on its bloody sleeve. That's fine and well, but a Christmas-zombie-musical has got to have a reason for its existence other than, ""Well, this sounds fun!"""
m/the_illusionist-2009,Christopher Lloyd,False,Sarasota Herald-Tribune,Fresh,4.5/5,2011-02-09,"The real reason little ones might not enjoy The Illusionist is that it's simply not intended for them. It's a poignant tale about regret, generosity and ungratefulness."

m/eagle_vs_shark,Jonathan Dean,False,Total Film,Fresh,3/5,2007-08-17,"Contrived? Yes. Second-hand ideas? A few. But this funny ha-ha, funny peculiar indie is lifted by a stand-out female lead - and writer-director Cohen could be the southern hemisphere's Jared Hess."
m/shazam,Vincent Mancini,False,FilmDrunk,Fresh,A-,2019-04-03,"Genuinely sweet and funny in a way that feels unforced. And whereas most superhero movies are inherently Calvinist, Shazam's refreshingly simple, straightforward message is ""don't be an asshole."""

m/1159100-oh_in_ohio,Eric Lurio,False,Greenwich Village Gazette,Rotten,2.3/5,2006-07-15,This is too clever by half.
m/green_street_hooligans,John DeFore,True,Hollywood Reporter,Rotten,,2005-04-07,Viewers hoping to understand the senseless phenomenon of football hooliganism would do better to rent Alan Clarke's nearly 20-year-old The Firm.
