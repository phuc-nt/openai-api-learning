m/anchorman,Susan Granger,False,Modamag.com,Fresh,7/10,2004-07-09,"An enthusiastic, harmlessly silly celebration of the empancipation of the TV newsroom."
m/cheaper_by_the_dozen_2,Tony Wong,True,Toronto Star,Rotten,1.5/4,2005-12-21,"Sequels tend to be stupider by the dozen, and part two is perhaps overshadowed only by the banality and pointlessness of say, Leprechaun 6."
m/red_2,Jeff Meyers,False,"Metro Times (Detroit, MI)",Fresh,,2013-07-19,"Bruce Willis expends so little energy shaping his umpteenth action persona that he can't even be bothered to crack a smile. Luckily, Helen Mirren, Mary Louis Parker, Brian Cox and John Malkovich are all-too happy to step in and steal the limelight."
m/munich,Jack Mathews,True,New York Daily News,Rotten,2.5/4,2005-12-27,"The failure of a movie that is so good in so many ways leaves me to wonder if Spielberg is up to this kind of complex, multitasking story."
m/1135882-uncovered_the_war_on_iraq,Michael O'Sullivan,True,Washington Post,Rotten,,2004-08-20,"After listening to this steady anti-Bush drumbeat for the past several months, even the most devout progressives may start to feel as if they've heard much of this sermon a hundred times before."
m/after_the_ball_2014,Andrew Barker,True,Variety,Rotten,,2015-04-24,Portia Doubleday stars in a frothy teen comedy as unobjectionable as it is unmemorable.
m/the_dilemma,Wesley Morris,True,Boston Globe,Rotten,1/4,2011-01-13,"A comedy that seems terrified to acknowledge its darker, more sinister self, it's like an overmedicated patient or an addict in dread of relapse."
m/1204946-children,Lucius Gore,False,ESplatter,Fresh,3.5/4,2009-04-02,"As killer kid horror movies go, 'The Children' is easily one of the best."
m/marrowbone,Dan Jolin,False,Empire Magazine,Fresh,3/5,2018-07-11,A solid rather than spectacular creepshow thriller that would have benefited from SÃ¡nchez employing a few more original ideas.

m/solo_a_star_wars_story,John Urbancich,False,Your Movies (cleveland.com),Fresh,3/5,2018-05-25,Han and Chewie heading into warp speed (then flashback) might have provided the early bolt the first act sorely needs. Still. it's an OK space vehicle for anyone but 'Star Wars' junkies likely expecting a better ride.
m/prairie_home_companion,Phoebe Flowers,False,South Florida Sun-Sentinel,Fresh,3/4,2006-06-08,"If one were to bring the sprawling program, which practically formulates nostalgia as a tangible commodity, to a movie screen, one couldn't hope for a better director than Robert Altman."
m/great_expectations_2012,Kyle Smith,True,New York Post,Fresh,2.5/4,2013-11-07,"An honorable, sober but completely unnecessary take on the Dickens novel, ""Great Expectations"" serves as a fine introduction to the story but won't excite those familiar with previous versions."

m/norbit,Drew Turney,False,Dark Horizons,Rotten,,2008-01-15,"The laughs are broad (pardon the pun), obtuse, and unsubtle."
m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Michael Sauter,True,Entertainment Weekly,Fresh,B,2014-12-08,"Sure, some of the puns and in-jokes sound a little dated, but any movie that strings together lines from Shakespeare merely as a throwaway comic riff is, in my book, a film for the ages."
m/war_dogs_2016,Brian Gibson,False,"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)",Rotten,,2016-09-30,"More a bland weapons-biz infomercial (ending with the crime-doesn't-pay fine print blown up to fill your widescreen) than a hard, sharp look at gunrunning or war-profiteering."
m/1029314-dick_tracy,James Plath,False,Movie Metropolis,Fresh,7/10,2012-12-10,"""Dick Tracy"" isn't in the top tier of comic-book adaptations, but ingenuous art direction and set decoration and some crazy make-up jobs create a film that's still a delight to watch."

m/foxcatcher,Stuart Klawans,False,The Nation,Fresh,,2014-11-13,"A story filled with dread but no suspense: a fable of the misunderstanding, heartbreak, irony and absurdity that can abound in America when two social classes grapple in mutual desire and animosity."

m/sling_blade,Brian D. Johnson,False,Maclean's Magazine,Fresh,,2019-10-30,"Stretched over 141 minutes, and threaded with humor, it is remarkably spare and simple, a slow movie about a slow man-Forrest Gump Unplugged."

m/anna_and_the_apocalypse,James Clay,False,Fresh Fiction,Rotten,D,2018-12-13,"ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE is no doubt a crowd-pleaser that wears its heart on its bloody sleeve. That's fine and well, but a Christmas-zombie-musical has got to have a reason for its existence other than, ""Well, this sounds fun!"""
m/the_illusionist-2009,Christopher Lloyd,False,Sarasota Herald-Tribune,Fresh,4.5/5,2011-02-09,"The real reason little ones might not enjoy The Illusionist is that it's simply not intended for them. It's a poignant tale about regret, generosity and ungratefulness."

m/eagle_vs_shark,Jonathan Dean,False,Total Film,Fresh,3/5,2007-08-17,"Contrived? Yes. Second-hand ideas? A few. But this funny ha-ha, funny peculiar indie is lifted by a stand-out female lead - and writer-director Cohen could be the southern hemisphere's Jared Hess."
m/shazam,Vincent Mancini,False,FilmDrunk,Fresh,A-,2019-04-03,"Genuinely sweet and funny in a way that feels unforced. And whereas most superhero movies are inherently Calvinist, Shazam's refreshingly simple, straightforward message is ""don't be an asshole."""

m/1191742_changeling,Roger Moore,True,Orlando Sentinel,Fresh,3/5,2008-10-30,"If the film is too long and a little unwieldy in its later acts, the consummate craftsman in Eastwood glosses over that with detail and righteous rage."

m/dangerous_beauty,Malcolm Johnson,False,Hartford Courant,Rotten,,2018-04-25,"Only McCormack manages to breathe any urgency into a tale that takes far too long to escape the fate of too many films set in Venice, in which San Marco and the Grand Canal's gondola fleet overwhelm story and characters."
m/3_days_to_kill,Tim Grierson,False,Screen International,Rotten,,2014-02-20,"""3 Days"" feels interminable, both too generic in its execution and too pleased with its irreverent attitude."
m/by_the_sea_2015,Brian Orndorf,False,Blu-ray.com,Rotten,C,2015-11-18,"When it isn't permissive with performances and indulgent with its run time, the picture has a few insightful ideas to share about loss and marital strife, but it takes considerable work to find such wisdom."

m/the_imposter_2012,Sean P. Means,False,Salt Lake Tribune,Fresh,3.5/4,2012-09-21,"Layton layers ""The Imposter"" with powerful images in the dramatic re-creations, as well as a brooding soundscape and a concise pacing that distributes its information with the reserve of a good mystery writer."
m/dear_wendy,Dan Jolin,False,Empire Magazine,Rotten,3/5,2005-08-05,"It's all very stagey and contrived, but thought-provoking nevertheless."
m/the_wilde_wedding,Chloe Walker,False,Film Inquiry,Rotten,,2017-10-04,"The Wilde Wedding is not very good. There are too many characters, which leaves no room for character development, or any meaningful arcs."

m/1052609-kid,Harriette Underhill,False,New York Tribune,Fresh,,2019-11-06,"The Kid is a vastly entertaining picture, but there are some things in it which, we believe, were better left unsaid. Why is it that Chaplin, who is really an idealist, always has touches of vulgarity in his pictures?"
m/vicky_cristina_barcelona,Laura Clifford,False,Reeling Reviews,Fresh,B,2008-08-14,"Writer/director Woody Allen has assembled one of his most unusual casts for his latest, European set film and his combination of recent favorite, new discovery and local blood sizzles and sparks."

m/1212640-eclipse,Amber Wilkinson,False,Eye for Film,Rotten,2.5/5,2010-04-01,"You can't help being haunted by the thought that if McPherson had picked one genre and stuck to it he could have had a serious hit on his hands, as it is, the terrific performances are eclipsed by the unsettled tone."
m/prometheus_2012,Nick Pinkerton,True,Village Voice,Rotten,,2012-06-05,"With this overreaching Prometheus, Scott seems a bit like David carefully arranging his hair in imitation of O'Toole's Lawrence. He can still mimic the appearance of an epic, noble, important movie -- but the appearance is all."
m/the_rundown,Bruce Westbrook,True,Houston Chronicle,Fresh,B-,2003-09-26,"The Rundown wants to stand out in a movie market gorged with action. But it regurgitates commercial dictates rather than carving a new path. At least it relies on a diverse, charismatic cast, rather than on spectacular carnage."
m/the_greatest_showman_2017,Kristen Lopez,False,Spectrum Culture,Fresh,,2017-12-20,"The Greatest Showman will work best with musical purists, those who aren't turned off by spontaneous bursts of song and an overly sentimentalized view of history."
