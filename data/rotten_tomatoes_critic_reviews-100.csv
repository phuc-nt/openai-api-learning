m/cheaper_by_the_dozen_2,Tony Wong,True,Toronto Star,Rotten,1.5/4,2005-12-21,"Sequels tend to be stupider by the dozen, and part two is perhaps overshadowed only by the banality and pointlessness of say, Leprechaun 6."
m/red_2,Jeff Meyers,False,"Metro Times (Detroit, MI)",Fresh,,2013-07-19,"Bruce Willis expends so little energy shaping his umpteenth action persona that he can't even be bothered to crack a smile. Luckily, Helen Mirren, Mary Louis Parker, Brian Cox and John Malkovich are all-too happy to step in and steal the limelight."
m/munich,Jack Mathews,True,New York Daily News,Rotten,2.5/4,2005-12-27,"The failure of a movie that is so good in so many ways leaves me to wonder if Spielberg is up to this kind of complex, multitasking story."

m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Michael Sauter,True,Entertainment Weekly,Fresh,B,2014-12-08,"Sure, some of the puns and in-jokes sound a little dated, but any movie that strings together lines from Shakespeare merely as a throwaway comic riff is, in my book, a film for the ages."
m/war_dogs_2016,Brian Gibson,False,"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)",Rotten,,2016-09-30,"More a bland weapons-biz infomercial (ending with the crime-doesn't-pay fine print blown up to fill your widescreen) than a hard, sharp look at gunrunning or war-profiteering."
m/1029314-dick_tracy,James Plath,False,Movie Metropolis,Fresh,7/10,2012-12-10,"""Dick Tracy"" isn't in the top tier of comic-book adaptations, but ingenuous art direction and set decoration and some crazy make-up jobs create a film that's still a delight to watch."

m/foxcatcher,Stuart Klawans,False,The Nation,Fresh,,2014-11-13,"A story filled with dread but no suspense: a fable of the misunderstanding, heartbreak, irony and absurdity that can abound in America when two social classes grapple in mutual desire and animosity."

m/sling_blade,Brian D. Johnson,False,Maclean's Magazine,Fresh,,2019-10-30,"Stretched over 141 minutes, and threaded with humor, it is remarkably spare and simple, a slow movie about a slow man-Forrest Gump Unplugged."

m/anna_and_the_apocalypse,James Clay,False,Fresh Fiction,Rotten,D,2018-12-13,"ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE is no doubt a crowd-pleaser that wears its heart on its bloody sleeve. That's fine and well, but a Christmas-zombie-musical has got to have a reason for its existence other than, ""Well, this sounds fun!"""
m/the_illusionist-2009,Christopher Lloyd,False,Sarasota Herald-Tribune,Fresh,4.5/5,2011-02-09,"The real reason little ones might not enjoy The Illusionist is that it's simply not intended for them. It's a poignant tale about regret, generosity and ungratefulness."

m/eagle_vs_shark,Jonathan Dean,False,Total Film,Fresh,3/5,2007-08-17,"Contrived? Yes. Second-hand ideas? A few. But this funny ha-ha, funny peculiar indie is lifted by a stand-out female lead - and writer-director Cohen could be the southern hemisphere's Jared Hess."
m/shazam,Vincent Mancini,False,FilmDrunk,Fresh,A-,2019-04-03,"Genuinely sweet and funny in a way that feels unforced. And whereas most superhero movies are inherently Calvinist, Shazam's refreshingly simple, straightforward message is ""don't be an asshole."""

m/by_the_sea_2015,Brian Orndorf,False,Blu-ray.com,Rotten,C,2015-11-18,"When it isn't permissive with performances and indulgent with its run time, the picture has a few insightful ideas to share about loss and marital strife, but it takes considerable work to find such wisdom."

m/1052609-kid,Harriette Underhill,False,New York Tribune,Fresh,,2019-11-06,"The Kid is a vastly entertaining picture, but there are some things in it which, we believe, were better left unsaid. Why is it that Chaplin, who is really an idealist, always has touches of vulgarity in his pictures?"
m/vicky_cristina_barcelona,Laura Clifford,False,Reeling Reviews,Fresh,B,2008-08-14,"Writer/director Woody Allen has assembled one of his most unusual casts for his latest, European set film and his combination of recent favorite, new discovery and local blood sizzles and sparks."

m/1212640-eclipse,Amber Wilkinson,False,Eye for Film,Rotten,2.5/5,2010-04-01,"You can't help being haunted by the thought that if McPherson had picked one genre and stuck to it he could have had a serious hit on his hands, as it is, the terrific performances are eclipsed by the unsettled tone."
m/prometheus_2012,Nick Pinkerton,True,Village Voice,Rotten,,2012-06-05,"With this overreaching Prometheus, Scott seems a bit like David carefully arranging his hair in imitation of O'Toole's Lawrence.

m/the_rundown,Bruce Westbrook,True,Houston Chronicle,Fresh,B-,2003-09-26,"The Rundown wants to stand out in a movie market gorged with action.
